Please copy these files over to your Isaac Sim 2020.2 folder before training.
Specifically, if you have access only to the public build, syntheticdata.py goes to _build/linux-x86_64/release/exts/omni.isaac.synthetic_utils/omni/isaac/synthetic_utils/scripts.
Else, you have access to the extension source build, syntheticdata.py goes to source/extensions/omni.isaac/synthetic_utils/python/scripts/. 
The other 4 files go to source/python_samples/jetbot.
